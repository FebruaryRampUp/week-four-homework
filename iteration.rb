## Create a method called `average` that finds the average of a given array of numbers.

def average(number_array)
  # here we need to iterate over our array in order to find the average
end

average([10,20,30,40,50])
# -> 30



## Now, create a method that takes a hash with first and last name keys and outputs their full name as a string

def full_name(name_hash)

end

penelope = {first_name: "Penelope", last_name: "Penn"}
puts full_name(penelope)
# - > "Penelope Penn"
