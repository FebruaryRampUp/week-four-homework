## Week Four Homework

### Part One - Manipulate CSV (List practice)

Using what you’ve learned about arrays, and knowing that data[0] will tell you the column headers, and that each item in the ‘data’ array is an array itself (try `data[0][0]`), create methods that do the following:

1. All of the `customer_company_name` values
2. The sum of the `transaction_charge` values

Hint:
Your code will likely look like:
```ruby
data.each do |row|
  # some ruby code
end
```
